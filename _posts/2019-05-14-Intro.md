## Practical Engineering for Impractical Ideas
Other than a clever tongue in cheek phrase, what does this mean? Well for me **"Practical Engineering"** is all about figuring out how to make something work, without getting bogged down by the technical details any more than required to complete a given task. Now for the fun part, **"Impractical Ideas"** are all about the silly daydreams all good engineers have. I don't care if an idea has market potential or will offer significant improvement to an existing solution, this blog is all about attempting to make silly daydreams into a reality without regard for the merits of the idea itself. While I hope that some of the ideas do turn out to be useful for the future, I won't waste my time evaluating that past if something seems possible to build.

## Closing thoughts
I hope I have kept this intro short and sweet, I am sure I will ramble a bit more as time goes on. The next post will be an overview of several of the projects I am currently working on with more detailed write-ups coming in as I work on them.
