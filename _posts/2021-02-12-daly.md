## Marie Maynard Daly
### Biochemist and pioneer
Marie Daly was a biochemist who overcame adversity in the 1950s to help lay the foundation for modern genetics and biochemical research. She became the first african american woman to earn a Ph.D. in chemistry in 1947, and only got more badass from there. Her research into histones was integral to understanding the structure of DNA, even being cited by later Nobel Prize winners in the 60s who discovered the helical structure.

### Short Biography
I will save myself the trouble of duplicating wikipedia and refer you to other blogs for the more biographical side of things. Dr. Daly was raised in New York and encouraged by her father to persue a career in chemistry. She excelled academically and recieved fellowships during the war effort to obtain her eventual Ph.D. By all accounts an excellent student and brilliant scientist, this blog will only touch on the high points of her career but a full biography would be a great read I have no doubt.

### Laying Bricks
One often misunderstood or poorly represented aspect of science is the mythos of the lone genius making a breakthrough. While this does happen, the true nature of science is that of a slow and relentless march forward, one pain staking step at a time. Dr. Daly's work was one such step on the path of modern genetics and biochemical research. You can't understand the genetic sequence if you dont understand its chemical structure, and you can't understand the structure without knowing the components. Her research allowed later scientists to limit their scope and eventually crack the genetic code.
